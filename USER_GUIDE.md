## 🔍 Stock Search & Analysis

### How to Search for a Stock

The homepage features a prominent search bar where you can enter any stock ticker symbol. Simply type the ticker (like AAPL, TSLA, or NVDA) and click the "Analyze" button. The platform will instantly display a comprehensive analysis of that stock.

### Understanding the Stock Analysis Page

When you search for a stock, you'll see several key sections that provide deep insights into the stock's potential.

#### Price Information

At the top of the page, you'll see the current stock price along with the day's change in both dollar amount and percentage. This gives you an immediate snapshot of the stock's recent performance.

#### Explosion Score

The Explosion Score is a proprietary metric ranging from 0 to 100 that indicates the probability of a significant price move in the near future. This score combines multiple factors including whale activity, insider buying, volume patterns, and Sacred27 technical analysis. A score above 70 indicates high probability of a major move, while scores above 85 suggest exceptional opportunity.

#### Sacred27 Levels

This section displays the key support and resistance levels calculated using the Sacred27 framework. You'll see resistance levels above the current price (where the stock may face selling pressure) and support levels below (where buying interest typically emerges). Each level shows the percentage distance from the current price, helping you plan entry and exit points.

The current price is highlighted in the middle, making it easy to see where the stock sits relative to these critical levels. When a stock approaches a Sacred27 level, it often experiences a reaction - either bouncing off support or breaking through resistance.

#### Whale Activity

This section shows which legendary investors are currently buying, selling, or holding the stock. You'll see major players like Warren Buffett, Cathie Wood, and other billionaire investors. Each whale's activity is color-coded: green for buying (bullish signal), blue for holding (neutral), and red for selling (bearish signal). The number of shares they control is also displayed.

#### Sacred27 Analysis Summary

At the bottom of the stock page, you'll find a summary that includes the current phase (measured in degrees from 0-360), the zone recommendation (such as CAUTION or OPPORTUNITY), and the confidence level. This gives you a quick overview of whether now is a good time to enter a position or wait for a better setup.

## 🐋 Whales Directory

### What Are Whales?

In the stock market, "whales" are legendary investors and fund managers who control billions of dollars. When they buy or sell stocks, markets move. By tracking their moves, you can follow the smart money and potentially profit from their research and insights.

### Exploring the Whales Page

Click the "Whales" button in the navigation menu to see profiles of eight legendary investors. Each profile includes their assets under management, investment style, win rate, and top holdings. You can click on any of their holdings to instantly analyze that stock.

The whales tracked include Warren Buffett (value investing), Cathie Wood (disruptive innovation), Michael Burry (contrarian plays), Ray Dalio (all-weather strategy), and several others. Each brings a different investment philosophy, giving you diverse perspectives on market opportunities.

### How to Use Whale Data

When multiple whales are buying the same stock, it's a strong bullish signal. Conversely, when whales are selling, it may be time to reduce exposure. Pay special attention to new positions - when a whale initiates a fresh position, they've likely done extensive research and see significant upside potential.

## 💊 FDA Catalyst Calendar

### Understanding FDA Catalysts

For biotech stocks, FDA approvals and clinical trial results are major catalysts that can move stock prices by 50% to 200% in a single day. The FDA Calendar helps you track these upcoming events so you can position yourself before the announcement.

### Using the FDA Calendar

Click "FDA" in the navigation menu to see a list of upcoming biotech catalysts. Each entry shows the company name, ticker symbol, drug name, indication (what disease it treats), event type (FDA decision, clinical data, etc.), and the expected date.

You'll also see a success probability percentage based on historical data and trial results, plus an impact rating (Medium, High, or Very High) indicating how much the stock could move on positive news.

### Filtering Options

Use the filter buttons at the top to view all catalysts, only those happening in the next 30 days, or only high-probability events (75% or higher success rate). This helps you focus on the opportunities that match your risk tolerance and timeline.

### FDA Trading Strategy

The guide includes a strategy section explaining that biotech stocks often run up 2-4 weeks before major catalysts as traders position for positive outcomes. On approval, stocks can surge 50-200%, while rejections typically cause 40-80% crashes. Using Sacred27 levels helps you identify optimal entry and exit points around these catalyst events.

## 👔 Insider Buying Tracker

### Why Insider Buying Matters

When CEOs and executives buy their own company's stock with their own money, it's one of the strongest bullish signals in the market. These insiders have access to information that the public doesn't, and they're putting their personal wealth on the line because they believe the stock will go up.

### Exploring the Insider Tracker

Click "Insiders" in the navigation menu to see recent purchases by company executives. Each entry shows the insider's name and title, the number of shares purchased, the price they paid, the total value of the transaction, and most importantly, how that purchase is performing today.

The current performance section shows you the gain or loss since the insider made their purchase. If an insider bought shares at $50 and the stock is now at $60, you'll see a +20% gain. This helps you identify which insider purchases are already working out and which insiders have the best track record.

### Sorting Options

Use the sort buttons to view insider trades by most recent, highest gain since purchase, or largest transaction value. This flexibility lets you find the insights most relevant to your trading style.

### Important Note

The platform only tracks actual purchases (Form 4 buys) made with the insider's own money. Stock compensation and option exercises are excluded because they don't represent the same level of conviction as a real cash purchase.

## 🔢 Understanding Sacred27

### What Is Sacred27?

Sacred27 is a proprietary mathematical framework based on the number 27 (which equals 3³, or 3 cubed). This framework identifies precise price levels where stocks tend to reverse direction or break out. The system is based on universal principles found in nature, geometry, and physics.

### The Sacred27 Number Sequence

The framework uses a specific sequence of numbers: 27, 54, 81, 108, 135, 162, 189, 216, 243, 270, and so on (each number is 27 multiplied by an integer). These levels act as natural support and resistance zones in stock charts.

### How to Use Sacred27 Levels

When a stock approaches a Sacred27 level from below, watch for either a breakout above the level (bullish) or a rejection and reversal (bearish). When approaching from above, look for either support holding (bullish) or a breakdown below the level (bearish).

The most powerful moves occur when a stock breaks through multiple Sacred27 levels in succession. This indicates strong momentum and often leads to explosive gains.

### Phase Analysis

The Sacred27 system also measures where a stock is in its 360-degree cycle. Different phases indicate different market conditions: accumulation (0-90°), markup (90-180°), distribution (180-270°), and markdown (270-360°). Understanding the current phase helps you time your entries and exits.

## 💡 Trading Strategies

### Strategy 1: Follow the Whales

When you see multiple legendary investors buying the same stock, consider opening a position. Use Sacred27 levels to identify your entry point (buy near support) and exit target (sell near resistance). Set a stop loss below the nearest Sacred27 support level to protect your capital.

### Strategy 2: FDA Catalyst Plays

Identify high-probability FDA catalysts happening in the next 30-60 days. Enter positions 2-4 weeks before the event when the stock is near a Sacred27 support level. Set a target at the next major Sacred27 resistance level. Exit before the actual announcement to avoid binary risk, or hold through if you're confident in approval.

### Strategy 3: Insider Buying Confirmation

When you see heavy insider buying in a stock, check if whales are also accumulating. If both insiders and whales are buying, and the stock is near a Sacred27 support level with a high Explosion Score, this is a high-conviction setup. Enter the position and hold until the stock reaches the next major Sacred27 resistance level.

### Strategy 4: Explosion Score Momentum

Scan for stocks with Explosion Scores above 80. These stocks have multiple bullish factors aligned and are likely to make a significant move soon. Confirm that the stock is in an accumulation or markup phase (0-180°) rather than distribution (180-270°). Enter near Sacred27 support and ride the momentum to the next resistance level.

## ⚠️ Risk Management

### Position Sizing

Never risk more than 2-5% of your trading capital on a single position. Even with high Explosion Scores and multiple bullish signals, markets can be unpredictable. Proper position sizing ensures that no single trade can significantly damage your account.

### Stop Losses

Always use stop losses based on Sacred27 support levels. If you enter a long position near a support level, place your stop loss 2-3% below that level. This gives the trade room to breathe while protecting you from major losses if the support breaks.

### Diversification

Don't put all your capital into one sector or strategy. Spread your positions across different stocks, different whales, and different strategies (whale following, FDA plays, insider buying). This reduces your overall risk and smooths out your returns.

### Paper Trading First

If you're new to these strategies, consider paper trading (simulated trading) for a few weeks before risking real money. Track your hypothetical trades and see how the strategies perform. Once you're consistently profitable in paper trading, transition to real capital.

## 📊 Best Practices

### Daily Routine

Start each trading day by checking the Whales page for any new positions or significant changes. Then review the FDA Calendar for any upcoming catalysts. Finally, check the Insider Tracker for fresh CEO purchases. This gives you a comprehensive view of where smart money is flowing.

### Weekly Review

Once a week, review your open positions against their Sacred27 levels. Are they approaching resistance where you should take profits? Are they holding support or breaking down? Use this weekly check-in to adjust your stops and targets.

### Research Integration

Use Whale Hunter Pro as one tool in your research process, not the only tool. Combine the insights from this platform with your own fundamental analysis, chart reading, and market knowledge. The best trades occur when multiple factors align.

### Community Learning

As you use the platform, you'll develop your own insights and strategies. Consider joining trading communities or Discord groups where you can share your findings and learn from other traders using similar approaches.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Page Not Loading

If a page isn't loading, try refreshing your browser. The platform runs on a development server that may occasionally need a moment to wake up from sleep mode.

### Navigation Not Working

Make sure you're clicking the text links in the navigation menu (Whales, FDA, Insiders) rather than trying to use browser back buttons. The platform uses modern routing that works best with the built-in navigation.

### Stock Search Not Working

Ensure you're entering valid stock ticker symbols (like AAPL, not Apple Inc.). The search is case-insensitive, so both "aapl" and "AAPL" will work.

### Data Accuracy

Currently, the platform displays demonstration data to showcase functionality. Real-time data integration is coming soon. The Sacred27 levels, Explosion Scores, and analysis framework are fully operational, but specific whale holdings and insider trades are examples for demonstration purposes.
